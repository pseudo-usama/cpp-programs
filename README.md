When I was in my undergrad. I wrote many programs learning different languages. And these are all those programs and projects. Some codes are also written by my friends.

There is no big projects here. I just save them as a memory.

Also some files in some directories are encrypted. Not because of me but some virus that attacked my pc ðŸ˜¢. The virus also leaved a message which is available in [virus message.txt](virus message.txt).
